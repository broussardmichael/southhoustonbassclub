The club thrives today with a roster of 20+ members.</p>\n\n<p>The club fishes ten tournaments a year; one every month, starting in February and ending in November.\nTournaments usually start between 6 am and 7 am on Saturday and the weigh-in is at 11 am or 12 pm on Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>Member standings are based on a point system, one point per ounce of fish weighed in plus bonus points for first, second, third place, and big bass.\nThe top six fishermen each year are eligible to fish the \"Top Six\" tournament at the expense of the club.</p>\n\n<p>The club meets at 7:15 pm on the first Monday of each month (unless it's a holiday) and fishes the weekend following the meeting (again, unless it's a holiday).\nWe meet upstairs at Bass Pro Shops in Pearland, TX.</p>\n<p>Anyone interested in coming to a meeting is welcome and you can contact us for more information, or fill out an application form in the Membership section for club consideration.</p>"
